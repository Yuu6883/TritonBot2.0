# TritonBot2.0
Ancient Discord Bot that belongs in a museum.

It has some fun commands (most don't work anymore due to external API changes over the years)
* Display corona stats - confirmed/recovered/death
* Query course info from webreg scrapped data
* Prompt Vim exercise
* Grade tracking for a specific course
* Run a game of life simulation from a given image (converted to bitmap based on rgb value), runs simulation, and render to a video
